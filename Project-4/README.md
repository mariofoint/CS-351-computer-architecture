# CS 351 ‚Äî Project 4: CUDA Programming

## üë®‚Äçüíª Project Objectives

This project explores the use of NVIDIA CUDA to parallelize and accelerate computations on a GPU. We implemented two separate applications:

1. A parallel version of the `std::iota` function.
2. A GPU-accelerated renderer of a Julia set.
## `iota` Function GPU vs. CPU

### Are the results what you expected? Speculate as to why it looks like CUDA isn't a great solution for this problem.
Not really. I initially expected the GPU version to be faster earlier around a 1,000,000. I know CUDA has overhead for launching kernels and transfering memory 
but I was suprised that even at 5,000,000,000 it was not faster. Since the task was simple the overhead cost more then the parallel benefits unless we go very large scale.
